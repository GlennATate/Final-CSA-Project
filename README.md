Description:
My game is a simple chess game with a few special functions.

How to Play:
There will be two players who control each piece based on the color they chose to be (black or white). 
There are six different types of pieces, pawns, rooks, bishops, king, knight, and queen.
There are eight pawns, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, one king, and one queen. 
Each of these pieces has different movement patterns. You have to drag the pieces with your mouse cursor and can only move one piece at a time per turn following their specific piece movements. 
“Generally, the pawn moves forward only, one square at a time. An exception is the first time a pawn is moved, it may move forward two squares. 
The pawn captures an opposing piece by moving diagonally one square - it cannot capture by moving straight ahead.” 
“The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares. 
As with captures by other pieces, the rook captures by occupying the square on which the enemy piece sits. 
The rook also participates, with the king, in a special move called castling.” 
“The Bishop moves in a straight line diagonally on the board. 
It can move as many squares as wanted until it meets the end of the board or another piece. 
The bishop cannot jump over other pieces. 
The bishop captures on the same path it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece.” 
“The knight moves unconventionally compared to other chess pieces. 
Whereas other pieces move in straight lines, knights move in an “L-shape”—that is, they can move two squares in any direction vertically followed by one square horizontally, or two squares in any direction horizontally followed by one square vertically.” 
“A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece or the move would place the king in check. 
The king is also involved in the special move of castling.” 
“The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. 
The queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits.” 

Special Features: 
There are three buttons above the board that have special feautures.
The New button creates a new game board resetting it.
The Resign button makes the current player forfeit the game resulting in a win for the opposite player.
The Quit button makes the entire code turn off requiring the players to run the code from scratch.
